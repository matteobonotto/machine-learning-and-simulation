"""
Solves the equation of fluid motion in a pressure driven pipe flow with periodic
boundary conditions on both ends. If started with an initial uniform profile,
the Hagen-Poiseuille parabula profile will develop overe time.

Momentum:           ∂u/∂t + (u ⋅ ∇) u = − 1/ρ ∇p + ν ∇²u + f

Incompressibility:  ∇ ⋅ u = 0


u:  Velocity (2d vector)
p:  Pressure
f:  Forcing (here =0)
ν:  Kinematic Viscosity
ρ:  Density
t:  Time
∇:  Nabla operator (defining nonlinear convection, gradient and divergence)
∇²: Laplace Operator

-> A rectangular domain (think of a slice from a pipe with
   circular crossection alongside the longitudal axis)
-> The left and right edge are connected by periodicity,
   representing an infinitely long domain in x axis
-> Top and bottom edge represent wall boundary conditions
-> A constant pressure gradient (in x direction) acts on the
   entire domain

--------

Expected Outcome

After some time the parabula flow profile will develop due
to a boundary layer developing by the viscous effects of
the fluid. This does not affect the total mass flux which
will conserve continuity. [NOTE: This is not fully correct.
The attained Hagen-Poisseuille profile is indeed independent
of the initial profile and just depends on the strength of
the pressure gradient.]

Solution strategy:

We do not have to consider the velocity in y
direction (aka v-velocity) since it will be constant 0 throughout
the computational domain. (and therefore also its derivatives)

Discretization of the u-momentum equation

0. Instantiate the u-solution field with ones except for
   the top and bottom boundary

1. Compute convection by periodic central difference

    u ∂u/∂x ≈ u[i, j] ⋅ (u[i, (j+1)%N] − u[i, (j−1)%N]) / (2 dx)

2. Compute diffusion by periodic five-point stencil

    ν ∇²u ≈ ν (
        + u[i, (j+1)%N]
        + u[(i+1)%N, j]
        + u[i, (j−1)%N]
        + u[(i−1)%N, j]
        − 4 ⋅ u[i, j]
        ) / (dx²)

3. Advance to next step by explicit Euler step

    u ← u + dt ⋅ (− ∂p/∂x + ν ∇²u − u ∂u/∂x)

4. Enfore the wall boundary condition by setting the u velocity
   at the top and bottom boundary to zero

5. Repeat from (1.) until a steady state is reached.


No pressure correction equation has to be solved since the
pressure gradient is prescribed constant throughout the domain.

------

Notes on stability:

1. We are using an explicit diffusion treatment (FTCS) which
   has the stability condition:

   (ν dt) / (dx²) ≤ 1/2

2. We are using a central difference approximation for the
   convection term which is only stable if the diffusive
   transport is dominant (i.e., do not select the kinematic
   viscosity too low).

A staggered grid is not necessary, since our pressure gradient
is constant. Hence, we do not have to solve a pressure poisson
equation.
