Two rollers are located on solid walls. They are rotated by 90 degrees and
connected by a rigid lever.        
The bottom left roller is connected horizontally to a solid wall by a spring.

A downward pointing force is applied to the top right roller, moving it
downwards and consequentially moving the horizontal roller to the left,
compressing the spring. This system experiences geometric nonlinearities due to
the large displacements that can occur.

The parameters to the model are: a: The vertical distance between the two
rollers b: The horizontal distance between the two rollers k: The spring
stiffness

If one sets a=1, b=1, k=200 the relation between displacement and force is the
following:

This function is based on the residual equation: r(F, v) = k(a-v)*(a-b/(sqrt(b^2

which can either be made explicit for F(v) or be solved for v(F) by a
Newton-Raphson algorithm (where one has to take to adjust the initial conditions
to differentiate between the three regions split up by the two extrema of the
function)

In this script, we want to first calculate a reference solution with known
parameters a, b and k. Then, we will assume they are unknown and are part of
parameter vector theta: theta_0 = a theta_1 = b theta_2 = k

Then we want to calculate sensitivities of a loss function J wrt to the parameter vector.
